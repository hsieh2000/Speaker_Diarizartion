- The folders **video_data**, **silero-vad**, **pyannote_models**, and **spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb** are too large to upload to GitHub.  Download the required ZIP files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cVUwoWZqzHzqUD7muNZe0YgVxplYf9y3?usp=drive_link), extract them, and replace the corresponding empty folders.
